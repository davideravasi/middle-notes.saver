# middle-notes.saver

Part 1 of the Data Scraping Architecture that I use to mine data from webistes.
In this solution (called Saver) I wrote the Console Application to load a list of Web Pages and store their Html into Db tables.
The second part (in working) use HtmlAgilityPack and XPath syntax to extract datas from the Web Pages saved before, using multiple DB configs.

# The Saver
Simple project about Data Scraping, managing Tasks and multiple Selenium instances, with a support of a MySql/MariaDb database, to configure bots and to store saved Web Pages.
